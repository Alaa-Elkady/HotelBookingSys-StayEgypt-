The resort has 8 different all inclusive restaurants from different places and a tasty coffee and the italian one was the best. Has an excellent set of swimming pools and a very clean beach with crystal waters. Friendly staff and an amazing experience of 8 ball pool and a tennis tables. A visit that will definitely happen again with a larger group of friends for the experience you get with not so much of a cost"

        "review": "The hotel is close to the airport, making the transfer time nice and short, but there wasn’t much noticeable noise from the planes during our stay. The welcome was warm, the staff all very helpful and polite throughout the hotel. Our room was a good size & clean and the bed very comfortable. We really liked that there were so many different places to eat. All the food was served to you at the table, which is unusual in our experience in all inclusive hotels, but we preferred that to buffet style. The food was excellent, the best we’ve had in the Red Sea and we have been here many times. The pools were heated, and clean. There was no trouble getting loungers, which were very comfortable. The only downside if you were hoping to spend time at the beach and go for walks along the front, your can’t because there isn’t one. We didn’t go in the sea (too cold for us!) but there is easy access off a short pier and there looks like there’s a nice bit of reef there. Overall this was a great place to stay and we would recommend it to anyone."
